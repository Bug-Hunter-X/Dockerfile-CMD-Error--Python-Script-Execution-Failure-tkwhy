# Dockerfile CMD Error: Python Script Execution Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile to run a Python script. The issue stems from an incorrect path to the script or missing execution permissions.

## Bug Description
The provided Dockerfile attempts to run a Python script using `CMD ["python3", "/app/my_script.py"]`. However, this fails because the script's location or permissions are not correctly set up. 

## Solution
The corrected Dockerfile includes the following improvements:
-  Copying the python script to the appropriate directory.
-  Ensuring the script has executable permissions.
-  Using a better base image with python pre-installed to make it more streamlined and efficient. 

Please refer to `DockerfileSolution.txt` for the corrected Dockerfile.
